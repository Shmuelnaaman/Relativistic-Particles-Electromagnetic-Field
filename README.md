## Version #.1

This Python-based simulation models the interactions of charged particles under relativistic conditions and electromagnetic fields. It incorporates special relativity principles, specifically focusing on the relativistic effects on particle dynamics and interactions based on Coulomb's law and electromagnetic field theory.

### Features

- **Relativistic Dynamics**: Accounts for time dilation and relativistic mass changes as particles approach the speed of light.
- **Electromagnetic Interactions**: Simulates electromagnetic forces acting on particles, including both electric and magnetic fields.
- **Synchrotron Radiation**: Models the emission of synchrotron radiation due to particles accelerating in magnetic fields.
- **Retarded Potentials**: Calculates the electromagnetic fields from other particles considering the finite speed of light, introducing time-delayed interactions (retarded positions and fields).

### Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- Pygame: For rendering and interaction.
- NumPy: For efficient mathematical computations.

### Setting Up

1. Ensure Python and the dependencies (Pygame, NumPy) are installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository or download the simulation code to your local machine.
3. Navigate to the directory containing the simulation files.

### Running the Simulation

To start the simulation, run the following command from the terminal:

```bash
python relativistic_particle_simulation.py
```

The simulation window will display particles moving within an electromagnetic field. Interactions, particle dynamics, and effects such as synchrotron radiation are visualized in real-time.

### Interacting with the Simulation

- **Add Particles**: Click in the simulation window to spawn a new particle at that location.
- **Quit**: Close the window or press `CTRL+C` in the terminal to exit the simulation.

### Customization

Modify parameters such as particle charge, mass, initial velocity, and electromagnetic field properties in the script to explore different physical scenarios.

### Simulation Components

- `Particle`: Defines particle properties and methods for updating dynamics based on relativistic effects and electromagnetic interactions.
- `ParticleManager`: Manages a collection of particles, handling updates and rendering.
- `electric_field`, `magnetic_field`: Functions defining the electromagnetic fields within the simulation space.
- Main Loop: Handles event processing, updates to the particle system, and rendering.

### Notes

- The simulation assumes a classical framework augmented with relativistic corrections for particle mass and time dilation.
- Synchrotron radiation calculations provide an approximation based on the instantaneous curvature of the particle's path in the magnetic field.

### Acknowledgments

This simulation is developed for educational purposes and is based on fundamental principles of classical electrodynamics and special relativity.
