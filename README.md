# Project Title: Accelerating Relativistic Charged particles in Electromagnetic field

## Description
This project is a physics simulation tool designed to model the behavior of particles under relativistic conditions. It incorporates both classical and relativistic mechanics to provide accurate simulations of particle interactions, electromagnetic fields, and the effects of relativity, such as time dilation and Lorentz contraction.

The simulator is developed in Python and utilizes numpy for numerical operations and pygame for visualization. It aims to serve educational purposes for those interested in understanding relativistic effects, as well as being a research tool for more in-depth physics investigations.

## Features
- Simulate the motion of particles under the influence of electromagnetic fields
- Calculate retarded electric and magnetic fields caused by moving charges
- Include relativistic effects such as time dilation and Lorentz contraction
- Visualize particle motion and field lines in real-time using pygame
- Scalable architecture allowing for the addition of more complex interactions and scenarios

## Installation
To run the Relativistic Physics Simulator, you need Python 3.x and the following Python libraries:
- numpy
- scipy
- pygame

You can install the required libraries using pip:
```bash
