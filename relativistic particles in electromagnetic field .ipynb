    "This Python script simulates the dynamics of charged particles under relativistic conditions using the Pygame library. It is designed to visualize and explore concepts such as electromagnetic fields, synchrotron radiation, and the effects of relativity on particle interactions. Here's a breakdown of what the script does:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Imports and Constants\n",
    "- **Pygame** is used for graphical rendering and interaction.\n",
    "- **Numpy** is utilized for numerical operations, especially in vector and matrix computations.\n",
    "- Constants like `WIDTH`, `HEIGHT`, `SPEED_OF_LIGHT`, and `ELEMENTARY_CHARGE` are defined for use in simulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Synchrotron Function\n",
    "- `synchrotron_function(x)`: Approximates a function related to synchrotron radiation, which particles emit when they are accelerated in magnetic fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Particle Class\n",
    "- Represents charged particles with properties like position (`x`, `y`, `z`), `charge`, `mass`, and `velocity`.\n",
    "- `update`: Updates particle's state based on electromagnetic fields and other particles. It calculates forces from given electric and magnetic fields and updates the particle's velocity and position considering relativistic effects (like mass increase at speeds close to the speed of light and time dilation).\n",
    "- `synchrotron_radiation_spectrum` and `synchrotron_radiation_power`: Calculate the spectrum and power of synchrotron radiation emitted by the particle.\n",
    "- `retarded_position` and `retarded_fields`: Compute the position and electromagnetic fields of the particle at previous times, accounting for the finite speed of light (this is part of what makes the simulation 'relativistic').\n",
    "- `relativistic_mass` and `time_dilation`: Compute the relativistic mass and time dilation effects based on the particle’s velocity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ParticleManager Class\n",
    "- Manages a collection of `Particle` instances.\n",
    "- `add_particle`: Adds a new particle to the simulation.\n",
    "- `draw`: Draws all particles on the Pygame screen.\n",
    "- `update_interactions`: Updates interactions between all particles, considering retarded fields, which simulate the delay in the effect of one particle's field on another due to the finite speed of light.\n",
    "- `update`: Updates all particles’ states and interactions between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Field Functions\n",
    "- `electric_field` and `magnetic_field`: Functions to compute the electric and magnetic fields at any point in space based on predefined distributions or configurations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Simulation Loop\n",
    "- Initializes Pygame and sets up the simulation environment.\n",
    "- Enters a loop where it processes user events (like quitting or adding particles with mouse clicks), updates the state of the simulation (particle movements and interactions), and renders the updated state to the screen.\n",
    "- Uses Pygame’s drawing functions to visualize particles and possibly field lines or intensity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts Illustrated by the Script\n",
    "- **Relativistic Effects**: The script accounts for effects such as time dilation and relativistic mass increase, essential when simulating particles moving at speeds close to the speed of light.\n",
    "- **Electromagnetic Interactions**: It computes interactions between particles based on electromagnetic fields, including those generated by the particles themselves, considering the retardation effect due to the finite speed of light.\n",
    "- **Synchrotron Radiation**: It calculates and possibly visualizes the radiation emitted by charged particles when accelerated, which is significant in many high-energy physics contexts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, this script provides a platform for visualizing and understanding the complex dynamics involved in relativistic particle interactions, including electromagnetic forces and radiation. It serves as an educational tool for illustrating concepts from electromagnetism and relativistic physics."
